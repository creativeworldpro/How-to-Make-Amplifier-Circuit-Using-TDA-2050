# How-to-Make-Amplifier-Circuit-Using-TDA-2050
The project about making an amplifier circuit using TDA-2050 sound IC. If you want to make a HI-FI power amplifier circuit, then you should use TDA-2050. The TDA2050 is a great sounding chip amplifier with lots of power The IC can output about 30 watts or 75 watts at 8 ohms loudspeaker. The TDA 2050 is a monolithic integrated circuit in a Pentawatt package, intended for use as an audio class-AB audio amplifier. The sound IC can be used in stereo or mono audio design circuits. The amplifier can output upto 5A current to drive speakers without any damage. It can also handle short circuits in both AC and DC rail without killing itself. This makes it robust to be used in automotive audio designs. The TDA2050 is breadboard friendly and hence can be easily tested using a breadboard.

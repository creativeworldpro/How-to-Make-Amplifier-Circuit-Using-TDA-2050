The project about making an amplifier circuit using TDA-2050 sound IC. If you want to make a HI-FI power amplifier circuit, then you should use TDA-2050. The TDA2050 is a great sounding chip amplifier with lots of power The IC can output about 30 watts or 75 watts at 8 ohms loudspeaker.

The TDA 2050 is a monolithic integrated circuit in a Pentawatt package, intended for use as an audio class-AB audio amplifier. The sound IC can be used in stereo or mono audio design circuits.

The amplifier can output upto 5A current to drive speakers without any damage. It can also handle short circuits in both AC and DC rail without killing itself. This makes it robust to be used in automotive audio designs. The TDA2050 is breadboard friendly and hence can be easily tested using a breadboard.

Hardware of this Amplifier Circuit

To make this amplifier circuit, we might need some electronics component. JLCPCB has its own parts library. JLCPCB has 200k+ in stock components, 24 hours rapid SMT assembly.

Connect Resistor with the Circuit

To make this mono amplifier circuit, 1st we connect resistor with the circuit. We connect 18 KΩ resistor with 1 no leg of this sound IC. Then connect 680 Ω resistor with 2 no of this sound IC and again 18 KΩ resistor with 4no leg of sound IC and it’s other terminal with 2no leg of Sound IC. 

We also connect 2.2 Ω resistor with 4 no leg of sound IC. Our all resistor connection is complete.


Connect Capacitor with the Circuit

Now we connect 1µf / 50v capacitor positive leg with 1no leg of sound IC. Then connect 10µf / 50v capacitor positive leg with 680 Ω resistor and another 10µf / 50v capacitor positive leg with 2.2 Ω resistor.
We connect one piece polyester film capacitor with 200µf / 25v capacitor. Then connect it’s negative terminal with 3no leg of sound IC.


Again we connect another polyester film capacitor with 220µf / 25v capacitor. Then connect it’s positive terminal with 5no leg of sound IC.


Connect Audio Input Cable

The 18 KΩ resistor was connected with 1no leg of sound IC, we connect it’s other terminal with 10µf / 50v capacitor negative leg and 220µf / 25v capacitor positive leg.

Now we need to connect Audio Input cable with the circuit. Connect audio input “L” cable with 1µf / 50v capacitor negative leg and audio input “G” cable with 10µf / 50v capacitor negative leg.


Connect Power supply and Speaker 

For output sound, we need to connect a sound speaker. Connect sound speaker one terminal with 4no leg of sound IC and it’s other terminal with audio input “G” cable. 

To operate this amplifier circuit, now we need to connect power source with the amplifier circuit. For power source, we are using DC 12v. We connect it’s positive cable with 5no leg of sound IC and it’s negative cable with 3no leg of sound IC.
Soldering & Cleaning Amplifier Circuit

It’s the time to soldering and cut-off all extra leg of electronics component. Now we solder all component leg carefully and to make sure we need to check all of them for several times. We also remember that, there should not be any kind of short circuit connection. For perfect inquiry, we should use liquid PCB cleaner to wash PCBs.
Thanks to JLCPCB for sponsor us such a quality PCB board.


Enjoy Sound

Our circuit is completely ready for use. To protect overheating, we need to use heat sink with the sound IC. Just plug-in power and enjoy the effect of sound.
